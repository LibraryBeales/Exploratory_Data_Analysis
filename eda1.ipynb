We will import `pandas as pd` so that when we have to call on fuctions from the package inour code we can juse use the shorter `pd` insteard of typing out `pandas` every time.  This may not seem like a big difference, but it is a common practice so it is a good idea to be aware of it in case you see code in the future using this sort ofshorthand for package names.  \n",

But right now, all we need to do is call the function and give it a the required parameter, a location of a file. In this case, the file location is a url.  `read_csv` will also work with a file path to a directory on your computer."

We could scrape the web again each time we want to do some analysis, but that would be a waste of computing resources, and the content on the web is not static.  Social media posts are deleted.  Items are removed from shops.  The format of websites changes making your web scraper obsolete.  So it is best to scrape once, and save the data locally. Saving it also allows us to easily share the data we are using with others.\n",
